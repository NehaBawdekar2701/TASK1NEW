# TASK1NEW
Project Overview
In this project, three trading strategies (or "alphas") are developed and backtested on a sample dataset. The goal is to capture different market inefficiencies and ultimately create a diversified trading portfolio. Each strategy is evaluated using key performance metrics, and a final portfolio analysis assesses the combined effect of all strategies.

Objectives
Develop Three Strategies: Each strategy targets a unique market characteristic, such as trend-following, mean-reversion, or momentum.
Backtest Strategies: Simulate each strategy on historical data with realistic assumptions for transaction costs, slippage, and execution delays.
Portfolio Analysis: Combine the strategies into a single portfolio, evaluate its performance, and analyze diversification and correlation benefits.
Features
The project provides:

Diverse Trading Strategies: Strategies designed around different market inefficiencies.
Realistic Backtesting Environment: Incorporates transaction costs, slippage, and execution delays.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Max Drawdown, Annualized Return, and Cumulative Return for each strategy.
Portfolio Analysis: Combines strategies, evaluates diversification benefits, and assesses correlations.
Step-by-Step Workflow
1. Strategy Development
Each strategy is designed to capture unique market behaviors, with clear rules for entry, exit, position sizing, and risk management:

Trend-Following Strategy: Aims to capitalize on sustained price trends by buying in an uptrend and selling in a downtrend. Commonly uses indicators like moving averages to confirm trends.
Mean-Reversion Strategy: Exploits short-term price deviations from an average value. The strategy assumes prices will revert to their mean over time, buying when prices are low and selling when high.
Momentum Strategy: Looks for strong price momentum as an indicator of trend continuation, using recent price strength as a signal for buying or selling.
For each strategy:

Define clear entry and exit points based on selected indicators.
Set position size based on calculated risk limits.
Implement risk management, such as setting stop-loss and take-profit levels.
2. Backtesting
Simulate each strategy’s performance on historical data, including realistic trading assumptions:

Transaction Costs: Account for trading fees for buying and selling.
Slippage: Model execution price deviations to reflect market impact.
Execution Delays: Simulate slight delays in order execution.
Key performance metrics used to assess each strategy:

Sharpe Ratio: Measures risk-adjusted returns.
Sortino Ratio: Similar to Sharpe, but focuses on downside volatility.
Max Drawdown: Identifies the largest decline from peak to trough.
Annualized Return: Projects expected return over a year.
Cumulative Return: Total return over the entire backtesting period.

3. Portfolio Analysis
Objective: Combine all three strategies into a single portfolio and assess its overall performance, aiming for diversified risk and increased stability.
Diversification Analysis: Measure correlation between strategies to ensure they capture different market inefficiencies.
Risk-Adjusted Returns: Assess combined portfolio Sharpe and Sortino ratios to see if diversification improves risk-return balance.
Trade Logs and Visuals: Compile individual trades, showing entry/exit points and performance. Visual aids like equity curves, drawdown charts, and correlation matrices highlight portfolio dynamics.
Results and Performance Metrics
Each strategy’s backtesting results are evaluated with the following key metrics:

Sharpe Ratio: Indicates the strategy’s risk-adjusted returns.
Sortino Ratio: Evaluates returns relative to downside risk.
Max Drawdown: Measures the largest observed loss from a peak.
Annualized Return: Annualized projection based on backtesting period.
Cumulative Return: The total return over the backtest period.
Portfolio performance includes additional metrics, showing how the combined strategies perform together and if diversification enhances risk-adjusted returns.
